Clustering Methodology

We implemented a K-means clustering algorithm using both customer profile information and transaction behavior
Features used include:

Customer profile: days since signup, region (one-hot encoded)
Transaction behavior: total spent, average transaction value, transaction count, total quantity purchased, average quantity per transaction, average price of purchased items
All features were standardized using StandardScaler to ensure equal contribution to clustering
Optimal number of clusters was determined using both the Davies-Bouldin Index and the elbow method
Key Metrics are 
Number of clusters formed: 4
Davies-Bouldin Index: 0.876
Additional metrics:
characterstics are in 
Silhouette Score: 0.542
Calinski-Harabasz Score: 1243.65
